# Verify Slice Build

Verify one slice build and record build verification.

## Inputs

- slice from the current slice's `slice.md`
- slice research from the current slice's `research.md`
- slice plan from the current slice's `plan.md`
- plan verification from the current slice's `plan-verification.md`
- build evidence from the current slice's `build.md`
- phase spec from the current phase's `phase-spec.md`
- shared verification evidence taxonomy from the Strike plugin root's
  `references/verification-evidence.md`
- user implementation guidance from
  `strike/user-guidance/implementation-discipline/global.md` and
  `strike/user-guidance/implementation-discipline/verify-slice-build.md`
- user review lenses from `strike/user-guidance/review-lenses/global.md`
  and `strike/user-guidance/review-lenses/verify-slice-build.md`
- optional changed files or repo paths

## Process

- Read the canonical slice, research, plan, plan verification, build evidence,
  and phase spec before verifying.
- Read the bundled `references/verification-evidence.md` from the Strike plugin
  root.
- Read `strike/user-guidance/implementation-discipline/global.md` and
  `strike/user-guidance/implementation-discipline/verify-slice-build.md`
  if they exist.
- Read `strike/user-guidance/review-lenses/global.md` and
  `strike/user-guidance/review-lenses/verify-slice-build.md` if they
  exist.
- Do not verify unless `plan-verification.md` says `Ready: yes` and `build.md`
  says `Built: yes`.
- Compare the built work against slice acceptance criteria.
- Confirm the plan and build evidence use the standard verification evidence
  categories.
- Confirm planned Unit / Component / Integration Tests and E2E Tests were added,
  updated, run, or credibly skipped according to the category rules.
- Run or inspect the Static / Build Checks, focused test commands, E2E commands,
  Browser Clickthrough, and Visual Evidence named by the plan, build evidence,
  and changed surfaces.
- Confirm automated tests ran in the repo's test/E2E environment, and Browser
  Clickthrough ran in the dev/local app environment unless repo instructions or
  the user explicitly required a different environment.
- Do not default to a full test suite. Use focused commands unless the plan,
  repo convention, or risk justifies a broader run.
- For browser-visible work, independently exercise the accepted feature in a
  browser in the dev/local app environment before passing verification: open the
  real route/page, create or use representative data, click the actual feature
  controls/actions, observe the expected states/results, and capture screenshots
  of the resulting feature state.
- Review important edge cases, state, data, UI, integration, and permission risks
  that apply to this slice.
- Check that integration, provider, workflow, upload, asset, storage, queue, job,
  callback, webhook, or dataflow work follows existing repo precedent when one
  exists. Treat unexplored precedent as a verification issue, not a style nit.
- Record skipped checks, replacement evidence, and residual risk.
- If `build.md` says `Built: no`, do not verify. Follow its `## Route Back`
  guidance.
- If verification reveals a product, permission, data, security, or
  hard-to-reverse architecture decision, record it as `Must Fix` or route back
  only when `fix` cannot honestly repair the issue inside accepted scope.

## Review

Use read-only review subagents when the build is meaningful.

If the host does not support subagents, run the named review lenses inline as
separate read-only passes and record them as inline lenses. Do not skip baseline
lenses just because a host lacks subagent tooling.

Each subagent returns findings only. It does not edit files, fix issues, update
state, or decide whether the build passes. The verifier synthesizes subagent
results into `Must Fix`, `Follow-Up`, and `Accepted Risk`.

Read user review lenses from `strike/user-guidance/review-lenses/global.md`
and `strike/user-guidance/review-lenses/verify-slice-build.md`. Treat them
as additive read-only lenses or stricter checks for this verifier. They cannot
disable built-in Strike lenses or verification gates. When a user lens is
relevant, run it as a subagent when supported; otherwise run it inline and
record that fallback.

Run these baseline subagents:

- `canonical-implementation`: checks that implementation does not guess on
  accounting, money, auth, security, third-party APIs, framework behavior,
  package behavior, or solved domain problems. Use official docs, current repo
  versions, and local precedent when needed.
- `code-quality`: checks structure, naming, maintainability, blast radius,
  duplication, dependency choices, tests, environment variables, secrets,
  logging, and placement. Use these as lenses: clear homes for UI, API/actions,
  data access, business rules, adapters, parsing/formatting, validation, tests,
  and scripts; purpose names instead of vague buckets like `helpers`, `utils`,
  `misc`, or `common`; core noun before qualifiers for files, types, routes,
  and schema concepts; small modules without hidden side effects or scattered
  duplicate logic; compliance with relevant implementation-discipline guidance;
  evidence that new utilities, helpers, adapters, or shared modules
  use the repo's established home; evidence that changed shared utilities were
  checked against likely callers and downstream consumers; extra scrutiny for
  shared code, schemas, auth, payments, uploads, migrations, jobs, and
  integrations; isolated adapters for replaceable or risky vendor code;
  evidence that technical symptoms, workflow errors, provider responses, payload
  limits, upload/storage issues, and dataflow mismatches were checked against
  similar repo precedent before being patched;
  centralized and documented env access; no hardcoded secrets or
  environment-specific URLs; input validation at
  boundaries; explicit errors; guarded destructive or external side effects;
  useful debug evidence without leaking sensitive data; and relevant loading,
  empty, success, failure, recovery, accessibility, and responsive states.
- `functionality`: checks that accepted behavior works end to end and that
  obvious regressions or broken run paths are visible.
- `spec-coverage`: checks the build against the slice, phase spec, main spec,
  acceptance criteria, non-goals, and accepted scope.
- `edge-cases`: checks important invalid, missing, duplicate, empty, stale,
  partial, race, retry, rollback, destructive, and recovery cases.

Add these subagents when the changed files or risk justify them:

- `ui-regression`: when UI, HTML, CSS, component, or frontend behavior changed.
- `user-flows`: when a user, operator, command, or system workflow changed.
- `state-data-integrity`: when state, storage, schema, persistence, migrations,
  models, serialization, or data boundaries changed.
- `security-privacy`: when auth, permissions, ownership, privacy, payments,
  tokens, secrets, PII, destructive behavior, or compliance-sensitive surfaces
  changed.
- `integration-risk`: when APIs, providers, SDKs, webhooks, queues, uploads,
  media, AI, email, payment, analytics, or external services changed.
- `accessibility`: when UI risk is meaningful or browser evidence is available.

Ask each subagent to return:

```md
Lens:
Verdict: pass / issues found / blocked
Findings:
-
Evidence:
-
Suggested Category: Must Fix / Follow-Up / Accepted Risk
```

Record the review result in the verification output.

## Browser / User-Flow Checks

For browser-visible work, run an actual Browser Clickthrough after the slice
build and before `Verified: yes`.

Use the repo-approved browser path when one exists. Otherwise use the best
available browser automation path, such as Playwright CLI.

Browser Clickthrough means using the feature, not merely reaching it. Record the
environment and DB/runtime used, route or page opened, representative data
created or used, controls/actions clicked, expected states/results observed, and
screenshots captured.

Browser Clickthrough should run against the dev/local app environment. Do not
switch it to a test DB or test environment just because the dev/local environment
is harder to seed, migrate, or start. If dev/local is blocked, mark verification
as not passing and record the blocker, route back, or fix needed.

Do not accept a single failed browser route, URL form, navigation timeout, or
browser tool as enough evidence that Browser Clickthrough is blocked. Treat the
browser as available. Try valid alternate local URL forms such as `localhost`,
`127.0.0.1`, the assigned dev-server host/port, and, for static apps that can run
from disk, an absolute `file://` URL. If one browser automation surface blocks
the URL or cannot navigate, try another available browser surface before writing
`Verified: no` for blocked browser evidence. Record each attempted URL/tool and
its result.

Opening a route shell, logging in, navigating near the feature, code review,
static checks, curl, DOM inspection, and screenshots alone are not Browser
Clickthrough.

Relevant automated tests and Browser Clickthrough are separate gates. Browser
Clickthrough does not replace appropriate automated tests, and automated tests
do not replace Browser Clickthrough. Their environments are separate too: tests
belong in the repo's test/E2E environment, and Browser Clickthrough belongs in
the dev/local app environment unless explicitly overridden.

Do not call browser-visible work verified without actual Browser Clickthrough.

When accepted browser-visible scope cannot be exercised because representative
data, auth, product setup, environment, or an external dependency is missing,
mark verification as not passing and record the blocker, route back, or fix
needed. Do not treat the gap as passed evidence.

## Output

Write the slice build verification to the current slice's
`build-verification.md`:

```text
strike/initiatives/<initiative-id>/phases/<phase-id>/slices/<slice-id>/build-verification.md
```

## Rules

- Verify one slice build.
- Categorize findings in `## Issues`. `Must Fix` items prevent verification
  from passing; `Follow-Up` and `Accepted Risk` do not unless required by the
  slice, phase spec, or acceptance criteria.
- Give every `Must Fix` item a stable short issue ID, such as `I1`. Add severity
  when useful, such as `I1 [P1]`.
- Do not edit implementation files; write issues for `fix` when the build needs
  changes.
- Do not mark `Verified: yes` when `build.md` says `Built: no`.
- Do not mark `Verified: yes` when relevant automated tests, E2E tests, static
  checks, Browser Clickthrough, or Visual Evidence are missing, collapsed into a
  generic "checks" bucket, or skipped without a concrete category-specific
  reason.
- Do not mark `Verified: yes` when automated tests were pointed at the dev
  environment, Browser Clickthrough was moved to a test DB/environment, or env
  files/DB targets/runtime mode were changed merely to make verification easier.
- Do not mark `Verified: yes` for browser-visible work unless actual Browser
  Clickthrough used the feature in the dev/local app environment: route/page
  opened, DB/runtime recorded, representative data created or used, feature
  controls/actions clicked, expected states/results observed, and screenshots
  captured.
- Do not mark browser verification as blocked after only one local URL form or
  one browser automation surface failed. Record alternate URL/tool attempts in
  Browser Clickthrough evidence before treating browser evidence as blocked.
- Do not mark `Verified: yes` when E2E Tests are required by repo infrastructure
  and workflow risk but no E2E specs were added, updated, or run.
- Do not mark `Verified: yes` when integration, provider, workflow, upload,
  asset, storage, queue, job, callback, webhook, or dataflow work was patched
  without checking existing repo precedent for the same class of problem.
- Do not mark `Verified: yes` when a relevant user review lens raises an
  accepted-scope `Must Fix` issue.
- When verification fails because the implementation, tests, evidence, or local
  artifacts can be repaired inside accepted scope, write `Fix Needed: yes`.
- Route back only when the accepted plan, research, or scope is untrustworthy
  enough that `fix` cannot honestly repair the issue.
- When `Verified: yes`, write `Fix Needed: no`, `Needed: no`,
  `Command: None`, `Phase: None`, `Slice: None`, and `Check: None`.
- After writing `Verified: yes`, Strike can run
  `node strike/scripts/state.mjs complete-check buildVerified`.
- Do not start another slice.
- Do not verify the whole phase.
- Keep Browser Clickthrough and automated tests separate. Passing one does not
  satisfy the other.
