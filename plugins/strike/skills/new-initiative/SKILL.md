# New Initiative

Start a fresh Strike initiative for a new idea. Preserve existing
initiatives.

## New Initiative Behavior

Use this skill only when the user wants new work. If the user wants to resume,
continue, pick up, or inspect existing work, use `go`.

Choose a short kebab-case initiative ID from the request, such as
`checkout-redesign` or `payment-system`. Use the optional name argument for the
human title.

If `strike/state.json` does not exist, initialize the workspace:

```text
node <this skill dir>/scripts/state.mjs init <initiative-id> [name]
```

This initializes `PROJECT_LANGUAGE.md`,
`strike/user-guidance/`, `strike/state.json`, copies the helper to
`strike/scripts/state.mjs`, and creates the first initiative directory. It
does not overwrite existing project language, implementation discipline, or user
review lens files.

If `strike/state.json` already exists, add a new active initiative:

```text
node strike/scripts/state.mjs add-initiative <initiative-id> [name]
```

This preserves all existing initiatives, pauses the previous active initiative,
and starts the new one at `refine-idea`.

If the chosen initiative ID already exists, ask for a different ID or confirm
that the user meant to resume existing work with `go`.

## Continue The Workflow

After initialization, continue with the same workflow mechanics as
`go`:

```text
node strike/scripts/state.mjs next-step
```

Invoke the returned workflow skill with the original user request, the returned
artifact path, and the returned completion check.

Do not implement from inside `new-initiative` itself. `new-initiative` only
creates or selects the initiative and then hands off to the step returned by
`next-step`. Treat that `next-step` result as an exclusive gate: do not create code,
tests, package files, verification artifacts, phase specs, or slice artifacts
until `next-step` points to the workflow skill that owns them.

After each workflow skill finishes, complete only the one check returned by
`next-step`. The completion receipt is not a workflow position and intentionally
does not name the next skill. Run `node strike/scripts/state.mjs next-step` again
before continuing. Do not batch multiple `complete-check` commands together.

If the work is interrupted after initialization, resume later with
`go`.
